# PromptMask

A local-first privacy layer for Large Language Models.

> Cloud AI is **smart** but sacrifices privacy.   
Local AI **keeps your secret** but is dumb.  
What if we can combine the advantages of both sides?

PromptMask ensures your private data never leaves your machines. It redacts and un-redacts sensitive data locally, so that only anonymized data is sent to third-party AI services.(*)

> (*): "Local" in this project is used only for terminology distinction, differing from Cloud AI whose privacy protection is questionable. PromptMask is fully compatible with any remote LLM that you trust to process sensitive data.

## How It Works

The core principle is to use a trusted (local) model as a "privacy filter" for a powerful, remote model. The process is fully automated.

![promptmask-workflow-digram](docs/assets/promptmask-workflow-digram.png)

I wrote a blog post with more details on the why and how: [How Not to Give AI Companies Your Secrets](https://xirtam.cxumol.com/promptmask-how-not-give-ai-secrets/)

## Quickstart

### Choosing Integration Method

Use this table to find the best way to integrate PromptMask into your workflow:

| | **Existing OpenAI-compatible Tools** | **Direct Use / Custom Integration** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Python Developers** | `from promptmask import OpenAIMasked as OpenAI` <br/>A drop-in replacement for the `openai.OpenAI` client | `from promptmask import PromptMask`<br/>For granular control over mask/unmask operations |
| **General Users<br/>(No Python)** | `http://localhost:8000/gateway/v1/chat/completions` <br/>Point your existing apps to `promptmask-web`'s local endpoint | Web UI `http://localhost:8000/` & Web API `http://localhost:8000/docs` <br/>For interactive testing or non-standard tools |

### Prerequisites

- A local LLM running with an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.   
By default, `PromptMask` will attempt to connect to `http://localhost:11434/v1` for masking sensitive information.

> [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) is a popular and straightforward option to run a local OpenAI-compatible LLM API. Other options include llama.cpp and vLLM.
> 
> Don't worry if you don't have a local LLM. PromptMask won't restrict a local address. You can always set a remote (trusted) endpoint as PromptMask's LLM API, such as a self-hosted GPU cloud or your trusted AI service provider.  

#### Choosing a Model with Benchmarks

> Choosing the right, capable local model can make data masking efforts twice as effective. 

See the [benchmark](eval/benchmark.md) to select a competent model that fits within your hardware limitations. Alternatively, run your own benchmarks using `python eval/s[1,2,3]_*.py`.

Local LLM Model ID can be specified in your config file (more detail on [configuration](#configuration) section)

```toml
[llm_api]
model = "qwen2.5:7b"
```

#### Using the Transformers Backend

PromptMask can also use a local token-classification model instead of an
OpenAI-compatible chat model. The recommended model is
[openai/privacy-filter](https://github.com/openai/privacy-filter), which is
designed specifically for PII detection.

Install the optional dependencies:

```bash
pip install "promptmask[transformers]"
```

Then select the backend in `promptmask.config.user.toml`:

```toml
[llm_api]
backend = "transformers"
model = "openai/privacy-filter"
device = "auto" # "auto", "cpu", "cuda", or "xpu"
```

This backend runs locally through Hugging Face Transformers. It does not call
the `llm_api.base` OpenAI-compatible endpoint, and it does not use the
prompt-based `sensitive.include` / `sensitive.exclude` rules. The model's
supported PII categories determine what can be detected.

For Intel GPU/XPU inference, install an XPU-enabled PyTorch build first. The
regular `promptmask[transformers]` extra only declares the PyTorch dependency;
it does not choose a hardware-specific PyTorch wheel for you.

```bash
pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/xpu
pip install "promptmask[transformers]"
```

### For General Users: local OpenAI-compatible API Gateway

Point any existing tool/app at the local gateway. It's the seamless way to add `PromptMask` layer without coding in Python.

1.  **Install promptmask-web via pip:**
    ```bash
    pip install "promptmask[web]"
    ```

2.  **Run the web server:**
    ```bash
    promptmask-web
    ```
    The console will display where the web server is launched. For example, `# INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)`

3.  **Use the gateway endpoint:**
    Simply replace the official OpenAI API base URL with the local gateway's URL in your tool of choice.

    ```bash
    curl http://localhost:8000/gateway/v1/chat/completions \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer $YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "model": "gpt-99-ultra",
        "messages": [
          {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "My name is Ho Shih-Chieh and my appointment ID is Y1a2e87. I booked a dental appointment on Oct 26, but I have to cancel for a meeting. Please help me write a cancellation request email in French."
          }
        ]
      }'
    ```
    Your sensitive data (`Ho Shih Chieh`, `Y1a2e87`) will be redacted before being sent to the AI company, and then restored in the final response.

    Besides OpenAI, if you are using other cloud AI providers, such as Google Gemini, you need to add `web.upstream_oai_api_base` to your config file (more detail on [configuration](#configuration) section)

    ```toml
    [web]
    upstream_oai_api_base = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/openai"
    ```

### For Python Developers: OpenAIMasked

The `OpenAIMasked` class is a drop-in replacement for the official `openai.OpenAI` SDK.

1.  **Install the base package:**
    ```bash
    pip install promptmask
    ```

2.  **Mask the OpenAI SDK in your code:**
    The adapter automatically handles masking/unmasking for standard and streaming requests.

    Simply replace `openai.OpenAI` as follows:

    ```python
    # from openai import OpenAI
    from promptmask import OpenAIMasked as OpenAI
    client = OpenAI()
    ```

    Full example:

    ```python
    from promptmask import OpenAIMasked as OpenAI

    # openai.OpenAI, but with automatic privacy redaction.
    client = OpenAI(base_url="https://api.cloud-ai-service.example.com/v1") # reads OPENAI_API_KEY from env

    # non-stream
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-100-pro",
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "My user ID is johndoe and my phone number is 4567890. Please help me write an application letter."}
        ]
    )
    print(response.choices[0].message.content) # access response.choices[0].message.original_content for original maksed one.

    # stream
    stream = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-101-turbo-mini",
        stream=True,
        messages=[
            {"role": "user", "content": "My patient, Jensen Huang (Patient ID: P123456789), is taking metformin and is experiencing nausea. What are the common side effects and management strategies?"}
        ]
    )

    # response chunks are unmasked on-the-fly
    for chunk in stream:
        print(chunk.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")
    ```

See more examples at [examples/](examples/).

## Configuration

To customize, create a `promptmask.config.user.toml` file in working directory. For example:

```toml
# promptmask.config.user.toml

[llm_api]
# Specify a particular local model to use for masking; model name depends on the inference engine; leave it empty to auto select the 1st one on /v1/models
model = "qwen2.5:7b"

# Define what data is considered sensitive.
[sensitive]
include = "personal ID and passwords" # Override the default one

# Change the default mask wrapper.
[mask_wrapper]
left = "__"
right = "__"
```

Check [promptmask.config.default.toml](src/promptmask/promptmask.config.default.toml) for a full config file example. 

Environment variables to override specific settings:
*   `LOCALAI_API_BASE`: The Base URL for your local LLM's API (e.g., `http://192.168.1.234:11434/v1`).
*   `LOCALAI_API_KEY`: The API key for your local LLM, if required.

<details>
<summary>Configuration Priority Hierarchy</summary>

`PromptMask` is configured through a hierarchy of sources, from highest to lowest priority:

0. `LOCALAI_API_BASE` and `LOCALAI_API_KEY` environment variables.
1.  A `dict` passed directly to the `PromptMask` constructor (`config` parameter).
2.  A path to a TOML file (`config_file` parameter).
3.  A `promptmask.config.user.toml` file in the current working directory.
4.  The packaged `promptmask.config.default.toml`.

</details>

## Advanced Usage: PromptMask

For granular control, import `PromptMask` directly to perform masking and unmasking as separate steps.

```python
import asyncio # PromptMask also runs syncrounously
from promptmask import PromptMask

async def main():
    masker = PromptMask()

    original_text = "Please process the visa application for Jensen Huang, passport number A12345678."

    # 1. Mask your secrets
    masked_text, mask_map = await masker.async_mask_str(original_text)

    print(f"Masked Text: {masked_text}")
    # Expected output (may vary): Masked Text: Please process the visa application for ${PERSON_NAME}, passport number ${PASSPORT_NUMBER}.
    
    print(f"Mask Map: {mask_map}")
    # Expected output: Mask Map: {"Jensen Huang": "${PERSON_NAME}", "A12345678": "${PASSPORT_NUMBER}"}

    # (Imagine sending masked_text to a remote API and getting a response)
    remote_response_text = "The visa application for ${PERSON_NAME} with passport ${PASSPORT_NUMBER} is now under review."

    # 2. Unmask the response
    unmasked_response = masker.unmask_str(remote_response_text, mask_map)
    print(f"Unmasked Response: {unmasked_response}")
    # Expected output: Unmasked Response: The visa application for Jensen Huang with passport A12345678 is now under review.

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Web Server: WebUI & API

```bash
pip install "promptmask[web]"
promptmask-web
# INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

It includes:

*   A simple **Web UI**
    * to try out features including masking/unmasking and the gateway
    * A Configuration Manager to view and hot-reload settings.
*   Interactive API documentation (via Swagger UI) at http://localhost:8000/docs
    *   **API Gateway** to take care of your privacy seamlessly.
    *   Direct Masking/Unmasking API.
    *   Edit promptmask configuration via Web API.
